This is a class with a simple purpose, it creates fictional headlines from the
British newspaper The Daily Mail.

They are well known for their ability to completely suspend all rational
thought and print the craziest nonsense. So crazy that parody is almost
unnecessary, but still a lot of fun.

To use this class, simply pop it somewhere in your python path and do something
like:

    import dailymail
    paper = dailymail.dailymail()
    print paper.headline()

Easy!

(P.S. If you work for the Daily Mail and find this library useful, please let
me know)
